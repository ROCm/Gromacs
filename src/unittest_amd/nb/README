A. Enviroment Intro.
This is the unit-test for the NB kernels which included nbnxn_kernel and nbnxn_kernel_prune

B. How to build/clean the code and execute it.
   1. make -f Makefile.gfx908; make -f Makefile.gfx908 clean
   2. Copy the testing input data from the intputData folder
      => ex: cp inputData/adh/*.txt .
   3. set a one argument to decide the calcFshift is enabled or not for the nbnxn_kernel
      => ./nbnxm.out calcFshift => ./nbnxm.out 0 or 1
   4. use rocprof to measure the time duration
      => rocprof --stats ./nbnxm.out 0 or 1
      You can see the result is results.stats.csv
