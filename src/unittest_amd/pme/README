A. Enviroment Intro.
This is the unit-test for the PME kernels which included spline_and_spread, gather, solve.


B. How to build the code and execute it.
   1. make clean; make
   2. Copy the testing input data from the intputData folder
      => ex: cp inputData/adh/*.txt .
   3. According to the dataset to decide the input parameter of the testing program
      => adh: 95561, water: 768000
         ./spline.out atomNum useOrderThread => ./spline.out 95561 0 or 1
         ./gather.out atomNum useOrderThread => ./gather.out 95561 0 or 1
         ./solve.out computeEnergyAndVirial  => ./solve.out 0 or 1
   4. Using rocprof to measure the time duration
      => rocprof --stats ./spline.out 95561 0 or 1
      You can see the result is results.stats.csv
